# Serve Shell
A basic Node app that takes shell (or other!) command output and writes JSON files. The purpose here is to run this as a cron job, and serve the static JSON via the web to get system stats easily.

Code is based on [zx](https://github.com/google/zx), and personally I'm using this for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Feel free to fork this and write your own scripts.
